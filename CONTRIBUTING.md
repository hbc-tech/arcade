# Welcome!
:heart: Thanks for your interest and time in contributing to this project.

## What We Use

- Linting: [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
- NPM: [NPM as a Build Tool](https://css-tricks.com/using-npm-build-tool/)

## Pull Requests

Please lint your changes before submitting a Pull Request. You can lint your
changes by running:

```console
$ npm run lint
```

Please avoid committing `package-lock.json` files for Pull Requests. When new
releases are put together, we'll update that file.

Please don't change variable or parameter names to match your
personal preferences, unless the change is part of a refactor
or significant modification of the codebase (which is very rare).

Please remember to thoroughly explain your Pull Request if it
doesn't have an associated issue. If you're changing code
significantly, please remember to add inline or block comments
in the code as appropriate.

## Thanks

For your interest, time, understanding, and for following this simple guide.
