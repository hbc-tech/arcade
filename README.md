# arcade

Arcade is the foundation for the HBC common app framework

## Structure

This repo houses several individual npm modules that make up `arcade`.
Modules reside within `/lib` and utilize common tooling scripts within `tooling`.
New modules should reside within a new, distinctly named directory within `/lib`.

## Working with Modules

Publishing, testing, or working with modules in any other way is as you might
expect; within each module's respective directory. Attempting to publish from
the root repository directory will result in a fun no-no message and error.

## Contributing

We welcome your contributions! Please have a read of [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
